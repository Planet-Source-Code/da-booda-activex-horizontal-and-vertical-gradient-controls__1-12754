Horizontal Gradient Control v1.1
Vertical Gradiant Control v1.1

Well here they are...
When Extracting this Demo don't bother making a directory, it's already in one
To open this demo, just open ActiveX Group
To run it just press play
If the control bars aren't activated or there crossed out on the design form
the make sure the control programs are closed

To use the controls in other applications
Copy HGControl.OCX & VGControl to
your Windows\System\ directory
and open your new application
go to project then components and choose the controls

To make changes to the propertys don't bother going thru the property list
just right click on the control and then go to properties
(This way you can see my good looking logo...)

Just experiment, don't worry I have it pretty heavily error trapped.

Feel free to make changes, It wont take much to make these things better
